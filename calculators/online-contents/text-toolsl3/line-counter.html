<p>Here’s a simple logic in JavaScript for how it works:</p>
<pre><code>
  const text = document.getElementById("input").value;
  const lines = text.split(/\r\n|\r|\n/);
  const nonEmptyLines = lines.filter(line =&gt; line.trim() !== '');
  console.log("Total lines: " + lines.length);
  console.log("Non-empty lines: " + nonEmptyLines.length);
  </code></pre>
