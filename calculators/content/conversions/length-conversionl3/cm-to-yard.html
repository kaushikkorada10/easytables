<h1>Centimeters (cm) – A Complete Guide</h1>
<p>Centimeters, abbreviated as <strong>cm</strong>, are a fundamental unit of length in the metric system. They are widely used around the world in everyday measurements, education, science, construction, tailoring, and more. This guide explores everything you need to know about centimeters: their definition, conversions, applications, comparison with other units, and how to use them in real-world scenarios.</p>
<h2>What is a Centimeter?</h2>
<p>A centimeter is a unit of length in the <strong>International System of Units (SI)</strong>. One centimeter is equal to one-hundredth of a meter:</p>
<p><strong>1 centimeter = 0.01 meter = 10 millimeters</strong></p>
<p>The term "centi" comes from the Latin word "centum," meaning one hundred. Therefore, a centimeter represents one hundredth of a meter.</p>
<h2>Symbol and Abbreviation</h2>
<p>The official symbol for centimeter is <strong>cm</strong>. This is used universally in scientific papers, educational materials, and measurement devices. For example, a 15-centimeter ruler is commonly labeled as "15 cm".</p>
<h2>Centimeter in the Metric System</h2>
<p>The metric system is a decimal-based system of measurement that was first adopted in France in the late 18th century and has since become the standard in most parts of the world. The centimeter is one of the smaller units within this system, especially when compared to meters and kilometers. Its simplicity and precision make it ideal for smaller measurements.</p>
<h2>Conversions from Centimeters</h2>
