<h3>What is a Date Calculator?</h3>
<p>A <strong>Date Calculator</strong> is a utility that lets you compute the number of days, weeks, months, or years between two dates. You can also add or subtract a custom number of days to/from a starting date. It's perfect for handling calendars, deadlines, anniversaries, retirement estimates, pregnancy planning, and countless other real-world scenarios.</p>

<li><strong>Add/Subtract Days:</strong> Quickly find what date it will be after adding or subtracting a specific number of days.</li>
<li><strong>Future/Past Date Finder:</strong> Enter a base date and a number to jump forward or backward in time.</li>
<li><strong>Working Days (Coming Soon):</strong> Calculate business days excluding weekends and holidays.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring Date Calculations:</strong> Determine recurring events such as “every 90 days from today.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Use a Date Calculator?</h3>

<li>Different month lengths (28, 30, 31 days)</li>
<li>Cross-year and multi-year differences</li>
</ul>
<h3>How It Works (Behind the Scenes)</h3>
<p>We use JavaScript’s native <code>Date()</code> objects and libraries like <code>dayjs</code> or <code>date-fns</code> to ensure precision and timezone-safe computations. Your input is never stored — everything runs securely and instantly in your browser.</p>
<h3>FAQs – Date Calculator</h3>

<p>Yes. It automatically adjusts for leap years, including February 29 in years like 2020, 2024, etc.</p>
<h4>Q2: Can I use this to find age?</h4>
<p>Yes! Enter your birthdate and today’s date to calculate exact age in years, months, and days.</p>
<h4>Q3: Can I calculate business days between two dates?</h4>
<p>Currently in development! For now, the calculator includes weekends by default. A “working days” mode is coming soon.</p>
<h4>Q4: Is the tool free to use?</h4>
<p>Absolutely. The Date Calculator is 100% free, requires no sign-up, and works on all devices.</p>
<h4>Q5: Can I subtract dates that are far apart, like across decades?</h4>
<p>Yes. You can calculate the time span between any two valid Gregorian calendar dates, even across centuries.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Historical Context – The Importance of Date Calculation</h3>
<p>From ancient civilizations to modern times, date calculations have played a crucial role in how we measure and organize time. The invention of calendars allowed societies to track seasons, religious festivals, agriculture cycles, and more. Today, digital systems handle date computations instantly—but the complexity behind leap years, month variability, and timezone differences remains. Our Date Calculator solves these problems for you with a modern interface and classic precision.</p>
<h3>How Date Calculations Are Used in Software Development</h3>
<p>Date handling is one of the most sensitive aspects of application development. Bugs related to date formatting, leap years, and timezone mismatches can lead to incorrect billing, scheduling errors, or even compliance issues.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Backend Logic:</strong> Calculate subscription expiration, content publishing schedules, or trial periods.</li>
<li><strong>Frontend Forms:</strong> Validate date of birth, deadlines, or event dates with real-time feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Database Queries:</strong> Filter records within a date range or generate daily/weekly/monthly reports.</li>
<li><strong>API Timestamps:</strong> Use ISO 8601 or Unix timestamp formats for reliable data transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our tool aligns with industry-standard JavaScript libraries like <code>Date()</code>, <code>Moment.js</code>, <code>Luxon</code>, and <code>Day.js</code>, making it ideal for developers, testers, and QA teams.</p>
<h3>Date Calculator for Accessibility and Inclusion</h3>
