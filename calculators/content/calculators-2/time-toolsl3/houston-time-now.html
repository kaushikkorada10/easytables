<h2>What Is the Current Local Time in Houston?</h2>
<p>Houston, Texas, operates on **Central Time (CT)**. From early March to early November, the city observes **Central Daylight Time (CDT)**, which is **UTC −5**, and reverts to **Central Standard Time (CST)** (**UTC −6**) during the rest of the year :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.</p>
<h2>When Did DST Start and End in 2025?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daylight Saving Time began:</strong> March 9, 2025, at 2:00 AM (clocks moved forward to 3:00 AM) :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.</li>
<li><strong>Daylight Saving Time ends:</strong> November 2, 2025, at 2:00 AM (clocks will move back to 1:00 AM) :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Houston Time Matters</h2>

<h2>Daylight Saving Time (DST) in Houston</h2>
<p>Houston follows the U.S. pattern of **“spring forward, fall back”**, shifting clocks forward in spring and back in autumn. DST was extended in 2007 to run from the second Sunday of March to the first Sunday of November :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.</p>
<p>This change, while aimed at energy savings and extended evening daylight, can cause confusion due to inconsistent offsets across global regions :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.</p>
<h2>Future of Permanent DST in Texas</h2>
<p>Texas lawmakers are considering a bill to keep Daylight Saving Time year-round, calling it **“Texas Time”**, but federal approval would be needed before implementation :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.</p>
