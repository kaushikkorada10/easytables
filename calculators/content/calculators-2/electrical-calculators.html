      <h4>Advanced Electrical Calculations</h4>
      <p>While basic electrical calculators handle fundamental tasks like voltage, current, and resistance, more advanced tools cater to intricate needs. These calculators are essential for engineers working with three-phase systems, designing motor circuits, or conducting fault analysis. They allow customization for power factors, line-to-line vs. line-to-neutral voltage, and real vs. apparent power calculations.</p>
    
      <h4>Three-Phase Calculators</h4>
      <p>Three-phase power systems are widely used in industrial environments. Calculators built for three-phase systems allow users to compute total power, line current, and phase current based on specific configurations (Delta or Wye). These are crucial for planning electrical panels, transformers, and heavy-duty machines.</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><strong>kW to Amps (3-phase)</strong> – Converts power into current based on voltage and power factor.</li>
        <li><strong>kVA to kW</strong> – Determines real power from apparent power and power factor.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Factor Calculator</strong> – Identifies how efficiently electrical energy is being used.</li>
      </ul>
    
      <h4>Wire Gauge & Load Capacity</h4>
      <p>Choosing the correct wire size is vital for both safety and efficiency. Undersized wires can overheat and cause fires, while oversized wires may be unnecessarily expensive. Wire gauge calculators factor in current, voltage drop, wire length, and material (copper or aluminum) to suggest optimal gauge sizes based on NEC (National Electrical Code) standards.</p>
